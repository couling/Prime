# This file is used by the package-project script in the 
# DpkgBuildTools project to build a build a dpkg package from this project
#
# This quite simply lists which files from this project to put where.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored as comments and
# white space. The special folder DEBIAN is used by dpkg-deb automatically 
# to control the project.
#
# Instructional lines are formed of four sections separated by colons ':'.
#
# action:source:target:file-mode
# - action 
#currently supports "file", "dir" and "link"
#file adds a file from the project to the target system (dirs are created automatically).
#       dir creates an empty dir and or changes it's mode.
#link creates a symbolic link on the target system.
#
# - source 
#link: must be a file relative to a file on the target system, this may be 
#   a file provided by the project or one expected to exist already on the target system
#   file: must be a file provided by the project being packaged
#dir: file is ignored.
# - target: must be a be a location RELATIVE to the root of the target system.
